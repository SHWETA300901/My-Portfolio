        <p>The body mass index (BMI) is a measure that uses your height and weight to work out if your weight is healthy.
          The BMI calculation divides an adult's weight in kilograms by their height in metres squared. For example, A BMI of 25 means 25kg/m2.

      <li class="about">Accuracy of BMI </li>
      <p>BMI takes into account natural variations in body shape, giving a healthy weight range for a particular height.

        As well as measuring your BMI, healthcare professionals may take other factors into account when assessing if you're a healthy weight.
        
        Muscle is much denser than fat, so very muscular people, such as heavyweight boxers, weight trainers and athletes, may be a healthy weight even though their BMI is classed as obese.
        
        Your ethnic group can also affect your risk of some health conditions. For example, adults of South Asian origin may have a higher risk of some health problems, such as diabetes, with a BMI of 23, which is usually considered healthy.
        
        You should not use BMI as a measure if you're pregnant. Get advice from your midwife or GP if you're concerned about your weight.</p>
