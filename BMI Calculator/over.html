    <p>To make things easier, we’ve listed exercises that must be included in your workout to gain weight.</p>
    <ol>
        <li class="about">Walking</li>
        <p>Walking is one of the best exercises for weight loss — and for good reason.

            It’s convenient and an easy way for beginners to start exercising without feeling overwhelmed or needing to purchase equipment. Also, it’s a lower-impact exercise, meaning it doesn’t stress your joints.
            
            According to Harvard Health, it’s estimated that a 155-pound (70-kg) person burns around 167 calories per 30 minutes of walking at a moderate pace of 4 mph (6.4 km/h) (5).
            
            A 12-week study in 20 women with obesity found that walking for 50–70 minutes 3 times per week reduced body fat and waist circumference by an average of 1.5% and 1.1 inches (2.8 cm), respectively (6Trusted Source).
            
            It’s easy to fit walking into your daily routine. To add more steps to your day, try walking during your lunch break, taking the stairs at work, or taking your dog for extra walks.
            
            To get started, aim to walk for 30 minutes 3–4 times a week. You can gradually increase the duration or frequency of your walks as you become more fit.</p>
        <li class="about">Jogging or running</li>
        <p>Jogging and running are great exercises to help you lose weight.

            Although they seem similar, the key difference is that a jogging pace is generally between 4–6 mph (6.4–9.7 km/h), while a running pace is faster than 6 mph (9.7 km/h).
            
            Harvard Health estimates that a 155-pound (70-kg) person burns approximately 298 calories per 30 minutes of jogging at a 5-mph (8-km/h) pace, or 372 calories per 30 minutes of running at a 6-mph (9.7-km/h) pace (5).
            
            What’s more, studies have found that jogging and running can help burn harmful visceral fat, commonly known as belly fat. This type of fat wraps around your internal organs and has been linked to various chronic diseases like heart disease and diabetes.
            Both jogging and running are great exercises that can be done anywhere and are easy to incorporate into your weekly routine. To get started, aim to jog for 20–30 minutes 3–4 times per week.

            If you find jogging or running outdoors to be hard on your joints, try running on softer surfaces like grass. Also, many treadmills have built-in cushioning, which may be easier on your joints.
            
            </p>   

        <li class="about">Cycling</li>
        <p>Cycling is a popular exercise that improves your fitness and can help you lose weight.

            Although cycling is traditionally done outdoors, many gyms and fitness centers have stationary bikes that allow you to cycle while staying indoors.
            
            Harvard Health estimates that a 155-pound (70-kg) person burns around 260 calories per 30 minutes of cycling on a stationary bike at a moderate pace, or 298 calories per 30 minutes on a bicycle at a moderate pace of 12–13.9 mph (19–22.4 km/h) (5).
            
            Not only is cycling great for weight loss, but studies have found that people who cycle regularly have better overall fitness, increased insulin sensitivity, and a lower risk of heart disease, cancer, and death, compared with those who don’t cycle regularly.
            Cycling is great for people of all fitness levels, from beginners to athletes. Plus, it’s a non-weight-bearing and low-impact exercise, so it won’t place much stress on your joints.</p>
        <li class="about">Yoga</li>
        <p>Yoga is a popular way to exercise and relieve stress.

            While it’s not commonly thought of as a weight loss exercise, it burns a fair amount of calories and offers many additional health benefits that can promote weight loss.
            
            Harvard Health estimates that a 155-pound (70-kg) person burns around 149 calories per 30 minutes of practicing yoga (5).
            
            A 12-week study in 60 women with obesity found that those who participated in two 90-minute yoga sessions per week experienced greater reductions in waist circumference than those in the control group — by 1.5 inches (3.8 cm), on average.
            Additionally, the yoga group experienced improvements in mental and physical well-being.
            Aside from burning calories, studies have shown that yoga can teach mindfulness, which can help you resist unhealthy foods, control overeating, and better understand your body’s hunger signals.

            Most gyms offer yoga classes, but you can practice yoga anywhere. This includes from the comfort of your own home, as there are plenty of guided tutorials online.</p>
        <li class="about">Pilates</li>
        <p> Pilates is a great beginner-friendly exercise that may help you lose weight.

            According to a study sponsored by the American Council on Exercise, a person weighing around 140 pounds (64 kg) would burn 108 calories at a 30-minute beginner’s Pilates class, or 168 calories at an advanced class of the same duration (26).
            
            Although Pilates may not burn as many calories as aerobic exercises like running, many people find it enjoyable, which makes it easier to stick to over time.
            An 8-week study in 37 middle-aged women found that performing Pilates exercises for 90 minutes 3 times per week significantly reduced waist, stomach, and hip circumference, compared with a control group that did no exercise over the same period.

            Other than weight loss, Pilates has been shown to reduce lower back pain and improve your strength, balance, flexibility, endurance, and overall fitness level.
            
            If you’d like to give Pilates a go, try incorporating it into your weekly routine. You can do Pilates at home or one of the many gyms that offer Pilates classes.
            
            To further boost weight loss with Pilates, combine it with a healthy diet or other forms of exercise, such as weight training or cardio.</p>

                To make things easier, we’ve listed exercises that must be included in your workout to gain weight.</p>
        
          <li class="about">Squats</li>
                    <p>Squats is one of the simplest lower body exercises that tones and strengthens the lower body and is often included in the weight gain workout. Once you master the simple squat form, you can progress to more difficult versions by adding weights.</p>
                       <h6>How to do it:</h6> 
    
             <ul>
     <li> Stand tall with your back straight and feet a little more than hip-width apart. Look straight with your arms extended in front of you.</li> 
    
    
    <li>Squeeze your glutes and make sure you move your butt backward, and not just bend your knees.</li>
    
     <li> Inhale, engage your core and start bending your knees while pushing your butt out. </li>
    
    
    <li> Sit down with your body weight on your heels. Go down till your hip joints are lower than your knees. ‘Coz that’s what a full squat is.</li> 
    
    
    <li>Hold the position for three seconds.</li>
    
    
    <li>Exhale, keep your body weight on your heels and start getting up. </li>
    
    
    <li> Repeat.</li> 
    </ul>
    <li class="about">Push Ups</li>
    <p>If you’re a beginner, push-ups are something you should definitely try. It is one of the most important exercises for weight gain when it comes to strengthening the upper body. Most importantly, push-ups help build muscle in your arms and shoulders.</p>
    <h6>How to do it: </h6>
    - Lie face down on the ground. <br>
    
    
    - Place your hands slightly wider than your shoulders. <br>
    
    
    - Slowly push your body up until your arms are fully extended. <br>
    
    
    - Lower your body until your chest nearly touches the floor. <br>
    
    
    - Pause and then push yourself back up. <br>
    <li class="about"> Lunges</li>
    <p>
        Just like squats, lunges help you in bulking up and toning your leg and hip muscles. It is one of the best workouts to gain weight. You can also increase the difficulty level by including weights or trying some lunge variations.
    </p>
    <h6>How to do it: </h6>
    - Stand up straight and flex your abdominal muscles. <br>
    
    
    - Take a big step forward. <br>
    
    
    - Lower your body until your thigh is parallel to the floor and your shin is vertical. <br>
    
    
    - Push back on your heel to lift yourself back up to your initial position. <br>
    
    
    - Repeat for the other leg. <br>
    
    <li class="about"> Tricep Dips</li>
    <p>
        Tricep Dips is yet another easy to do arm and back exercise to gain weight at home. When done correctly, dips can add muscle mass to your upper body. This workout can also help build your strength for other exercises like a bench press. 
    </p>
    <h6>How to do it: </h6>
    - Sit at the edge of the chair or a bench and hold the edges with your hands. <br>
    
    
    - Move out of the seat and lower your hips towards the floor. <br>
    
    
    - Hold the position by keeping the pressure on your palms. <br>
    
    
    - Return slowly to the seating position. <br>
    <li class="about">Pull-ups</li>
    <p>
        Pull-ups, especially with weights, are a great way to increase your muscle size. If you’re a beginner, start by performing simple pull-ups and shift to weighted pull-ups as you gradually gain strength. If you’re doing this weight gain exercise at home, you can use a pull-up bar to do it.
    </p>
    <h6>How to do it: </h6>
    - Grip the pull up bar with both hands while your palms face away from you and arms shoulder-width apart. <br>
    
    
    - Pull yourself up enough so that your feet aren’t touching the ground and continue to do so until your chin is above the bar. <br>
    
    
    - Now, slowly lower yourself so that your arms are straight again. <br>
    
    
    - Repeat.<br>
            
        </ol>
